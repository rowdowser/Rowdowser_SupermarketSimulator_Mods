# Rowdowser_SupermarketSimulator_Mods

Here is a collection of any mods I made for the Steam game Supermarket Simulator, each in its own project.

If you want to build them yourself, you need to add references to the dlls from your own copy of game which should be found in "Supermarket Simulator\Supermarket Simulator_Data\Managed."  
They require this mod to be installed first [Tobey's BepInEx x MelonLoader Pack for Supermarket Simulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/supermarketsimulator/mods/9).

They are also located on Nexus Mods with more details:
- [All Lights Turn On Automatically](https://www.nexusmods.com/supermarketsimulator/mods/829)
- [Customers Change Checkouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/supermarketsimulator/mods/828)

These 2 links helped me a lot with creating the mods:
